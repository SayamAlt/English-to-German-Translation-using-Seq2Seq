## Overview

Machine translation (MT) is an important sub-field of natural language processing that aims to translate natural languages using computers. In recent years, end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great success and has become the new mainstream method in practical MT systems.

The global dissemination of new ideas, expertise, and information requires translation. To establish successful cross-cultural communication, it is vitally required. Translation plays a role in the dissemination of new knowledge and has the power to alter history. 

Machine translation technology can help law firms and corporate legal departments understand and process large quantities of legal documents quickly. Machine translation can handle most of the volume, but there is no margin for error in legal translations.
